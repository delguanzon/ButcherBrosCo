Its marbling and muscle fiber make it perfect for high heat grilling and other fast cooking methods. Snake River Farms beef features a buttery texture, complex flavors, subtle sweetness, and a lingering finish.",

Often marinated beforehand to minimize toughness, it is the cut of choice for fajitas, ranchera, churrasco, and many stir fry dishes. Snake River Farms beef features a buttery texture, complex flavors, subtle sweetness, and a lingering finish.",

Portioned into steaks, Filet Mignon is best grilled or cooked over high heat. Left whole, the Tenderloin Roast is the perfect main attraction for holidays and other special occasions.
